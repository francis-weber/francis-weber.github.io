# Using the Hough Transform for Line Detection

Today I would like to talk about the Hough Transform, which is a technique used for detecting lines in images

## How it works

The Hough transform works by converting points in image space to curves in the parameter space. While these curves intersect, they will reveal lines in the original image. Similarly to Gaussian Blur, this is super simple to implement in openCV.

```python
# First, edge detection
edges = cv.Canny(img, 50, 150)
# Apply Hough Transform
lines = cv.HoughLines(edges, 1, np.pi/180, threshold=150)
```

From this, the Hough Transform finds all lines where atleast 150 points in the edge image line up. This threshold is pretty useful, as it makes the system better at filtering out undesire smaller lines, which may only be detected due to image noise.

So far in the course, I've used this method for detecting cables in a train pentograph video, as well as road lines in a still image.

In the real world, this has many other useful applications, like:
- Line Detection in Cars
- Detecting Shapes (often rectangular) in images
- Identifying structural elements of buildings
